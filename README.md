## Black and White Image Colourisation using Deep Learning Techniques
> Dissertation by **Fabian Muscat**

### Overview

📚 This dissertation explores the application of deep learning models for image colourisation tasks. It focuses on converting black and white images to their colour counterparts using various deep learning techniques. The project covers topics such as generative adversarial networks and autoencoders for colourisation. Implementation examples and experiments are provided using popular frameworks like **Keras** and **TensorFlow**, along with Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the step-by-step process.

### Requirements

To run the Jupyter notebooks and execute the code in this dissertation, the following requirements should be met:

- **Python 3.10.9** 🐍
- **Keras** (version 2.11.0) ⚙️
- **TensorFlow** (version 2.11.0) 🧠
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓
- **Google Colab** (optional, for running notebooks with GPU support) 🖥️

Please refer to the official documentation of each framework for installation instructions and further details.

### Folder Hierarchy

- **dataset**: This folder contains the dataset used for training and evaluating the deep learning models. Due to its large size, the dataset is not included in this GitHub repository. You can find and download the dataset from [LINK_TO_DATASET](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-7xU0vw6aWqGdeINUrxrFXF-_exkjl4r?usp=sharing) 📂.

- **src**: This folder contains the source code, scripts, notebooks, trained models, and plots used in the dissertation. It is organized into subfolders for better organization and easy access to different components of the project.

- **survey**: This folder contains the survey questions and responses for each model (autoencoders and generative adversarial networks). It includes the questionnaire used to collect feedback and insights from participants regarding the effectiveness and quality of the colourisation models.

Please note that the **dataset** folder is not included in this GitHub repository, but you can download it separately using the provided link.

🚀 Happy exploring and colourising images with deep learning techniques! 🎨
